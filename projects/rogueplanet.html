        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            Rogue Planet was built as a capstone project by myself, <a href="https://sarahannealice.netlify.app/projects">Sarah Newman</a>, <a href="https://www.ewanbaxter.ca/">Ewan Baxter</a>, and <a href="https://rhend.netlify.app/">Riley Pike</a>.
            <br><br>
            In this game built using the Unity game engine, you play as a stranded explorer whose ship is no longer space-worthy. At night the vicious endemic creatures
            attack you relentlessly, and during the day the planet's scorching sun forces you underground where you have to mine for materials to
            repair your ship with.

        <h2>Project Process</h2>
        <p>
            My little niche in the project was the enemies. I had wanted to play around with different enemy types and ai. I began by
            creating a base class structure for all enemies, then branching that out into melee and ranged types. I was very ambitious at the beginning,
            wanting to incorporate lots more creature types (flying, burrowing, etc.), but with time constraints I chose to just polish the simpler types first.
            <br><br>
            I learned about simple mechanics to write into enemy behaviour, such as pursuing the player and standing in range to fire (for ranged enemies). I also worked
            on making an enemy spawner whose parameters (spawn rate, enemy type) were easily tweak-able using a custom editor menu.
            <br><br>
            Something I think worth mentioning is that the class structure of the enemies, and the design of the spawners to use an
            instance of an enemy to determine the spawn type, were inspired by the example from <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/prototype.html">Prototype pattern</a>
             in <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com">Game Programming Patterns</a>.
            <br><br>
            Another piece I worked on was designing the game's health system. I designed game components for both Health and Attack data,
            to be attached to anything that could take and/or deal damage. I then required trigger colliders for anything these components were attached to,
            so that the damage logic could come into effect on the trigger.

        <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            This project was all of our first real experience creating a game together, and even though we only had 3 months
            to work on this I think we're all extremely proud of the final product. We communicated well as a team and
            everybody pulled their weight, resulting in one of the most fun projects I've worked on yet as a developer.
